A staple of Rochester summers is the annual 'Down by the Riverside' concert series. For seven consecutive Sunday evenings, Mayo Park is awash with 30 to 60-somethings eager to escape their modest suburban dwellings and re-immerse themselves in the washed out hits of years past. The [waves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynbHVnRV4zQ) of [nostalgia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKg2ici2yG4) are [palpable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmtE8H6zn78).  

Last Sunday's headliner was Cracker, a 90s alt. rock group that somehow managed to push the limits of mediocrity even in its prime. I'm not entirely sure why I went; the notion that what must have been days of contemplation led to their choosing *that* moniker for themselves (ironically or not) did nothing to inspire confidence, but I guess I do have a penchant for the fruits of poor execution, and, at any rate, the list of enticing things to do for an unemployed 21-year-old in this town tops out at free live music. I gave the Cracker discography a perfunctory listen-through (in the event that there was a cue for the audience to bust out the Macarena or something; it's highly embarrassing not to be in the know), and then I was off.   

It would be rude of me not to mention the highlights of the opening act, but I just can't bring myself to do it. The following picture of the openers (The Modern Era) will have to suffice. The gentleman obscured by the lamppost definitely married up. Good for him.

An hour later, Cracker walked onstage to the dulcet sound of Europe's most obscure downtempo track, "The Final Countdown," on the loudspeakers. This alone nearly compelled me to walk home, but somehow I managed to retain my senses, and soon the absurdity morphed into dissonance as David Lowery's raspy vocals besieged my eardrums.   

I don't have much to report on the music itself. The setlist, as far as I can remember, included "The World is Mine" (lots of repetition of that title phrase), "Around the World" (I much prefer Daft Punk's version), "I See the Light" (this one wasn't too bad), and a song which expounded on the idyllic life of being from eastern California (something about having ample space to park trucks), at which point I completely stopped paying attention to the music and started observing the humans milling about instead. The aforementioned gentleman in the blue shirt was abysmally inept at keeping his toddler off of the bikepath, and the lady next to me made the mistake of asking a panhandler "what for?" before declaring that she had no cash. Even this riveting series of events lost my interest after a while, and I ended up zoning out for the next hour or so.   

Where am I going with this? I have no idea. A cursory browsing of this site would probably lead you to believe that this is an outlet for something. You may very well be correct; there's cynicism that breeds amusement, there's the kind that begets annoyance, and I skirt that line only to find myself on the latter side way too often. Recently I've been doing everything I can to curb that part of me. I guess it's all about framing things a certain way (there might be more on this later) because on my way home I came to a realization that I otherwise never would have: despite the music being vastly inferior to that of most other Riverside concerts I've attended, despite the utter lack of interesting human activity - despite the whole experience being *exactly what I expected it to be* - I still had a pretty good time. I might even venture out to see Cracker again if I get another chance. And if that isn't the greatest testament to the power of live music, I don't know what is.   

Baby steps.
